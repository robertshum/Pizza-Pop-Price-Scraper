If Puppeteer is retrieving different results from a webpage compared to a regular browser, there could be several reasons behind the discrepancy. Here are a few common factors to consider:

**User Agent:**\
Puppeteer allows you to specify a custom User Agent for the browser. If you're using a non-standard User Agent or not setting it at all, the website may serve different content or apply different behaviors based on the User Agent. Ensure that the User Agent in Puppeteer matches the User Agent of the browser you're comparing with.

**JavaScript Execution:**\
Puppeteer interacts with web pages using the Chrome DevTools Protocol, which means it executes JavaScript in the context of the page. If the webpage relies heavily on JavaScript to render or modify its content, there could be differences in how the JavaScript code is executed or supported by Puppeteer's bundled Chromium version compared to a regular browser.

**Network Requests:**\
Puppeteer intercepts and controls network requests made by the page. It's possible that certain requests are blocked or modified by Puppeteer, resulting in different responses from the server. Check for any intercepted requests or network-related configurations in your Puppeteer code that may affect the page content.

**Browser Extensions:**\
Puppeteer starts with a clean browser profile without any extensions installed. If the webpage relies on browser extensions for certain functionality or content, it could lead to discrepancies between Puppeteer and a regular browser. Disable any relevant extensions in the regular browser to see if they impact the results.

**Browser Viewport and Dimensions:**\
Puppeteer allows you to set custom viewport dimensions for the browser. If the webpage's layout or behavior is responsive or viewport-dependent, make sure the viewport settings in Puppeteer match the regular browser's viewport to ensure consistent results.

It's worth investigating these factors and comparing the behavior of Puppeteer with a regular browser to identify the specific cause of the discrepancies.
